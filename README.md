sum-kinda-image-browser
=======================
Ultra simple single file image browser in php, useful for quickly cycling through a folderful of images. Images will fit on screen via css, but no resizing/thumbnail generation happens, so if they're big, they'll take their time.
Just add this index.php to the /folder/with/the/images/ and enjoy
